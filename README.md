# Ansible 4 Everyone
This is a short presentation on Ansible and what it can do in tandem with Docker

## Running the Example
The examples are currently targeting a vagrant box I setup locally (see Vagrantfile).
You'll need to have Vagrant and Docker installed, but everything else is containerized.
```
make console
make
```
